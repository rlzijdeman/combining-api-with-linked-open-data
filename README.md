# Combining API and Linked Open Data
This is a small use case to demonstrate how data from an API, can be augmented with Linked Open Data. Using the [How many are people are in space right now?](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) API, we answer the question from what countries the astronauts in space are, using Wikidata and Python.
