# Combining API and Linked Open Data
This is a small use case to demonstrate how data from an API, can be augmented with Linked Open Data. 

Using the [How many are people are in space right now?](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) API, we answer the question *from what countries the astronauts currently in space are*, using [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

The use case underlines the importance and great benefit of having Linked Data resources, that so easily allow for data to be augmented.
